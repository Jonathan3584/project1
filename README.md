Game Project for WDI


Name of the Game:  Sorry!

Rules (pulled from Wikipedia):

Each player chooses four pawns of one color and places them in his or her Start. One player is selected to play first.

Each player in turn draws one card from the deck and follows its instructions. To begin the game, all of a player's four pawns are restricted to Start; a player can only move them out onto the rest of the board if he or she draws a 1 or 2 card. A 1 or a 2 places a pawn on the space directly outside of start (a 2 does not entitle the pawn to move a second space).

The Relaxation Start: When a young player is playing, especially when learning the game of Sorry!, a relaxation is offered in allowing one of his or her pawns to begin the game already on the board, on the space directly outside his or her Start, as the tedium of waiting for a 1 or a 2 can be wearisome even for experienced players.

A pawn can jump over any other pawn during its move. However, two pawns cannot occupy the same square; a pawn that lands on a square occupied by another player's pawn "bumps" that pawn back to its own Start. Players can not bump their own pawns back to Start; if the only way to complete a move would result in a player bumping his or her own pawn, the player's pawns remain in place and the player loses his or her turn.

If a pawn lands at the start of a slide (except those of its own color), either by direct movement or as the result of a switch from an 11 card or a Sorry card, it immediately "slides" to the last square of the slide. All pawns on all spaces of the slide (including those belonging to the sliding player) are sent back to their respective Starts.[4]

The last five squares before each player's Home are "Safety Zones", and are specially colored corresponding to the colors of the Homes they lead to. Access is limited to pawns of the same color. Pawns inside the Safety Zones are immune to being bumped by opponent's pawns or being switched with opponents' pawns via 11 or Sorry! cards. However, if a pawn is forced via a 10 or 4 card to move backwards out of the Safety Zone, it is no longer considered "safe" and may be bumped by or switched with opponents' pawns as usual until it re-enters the Safety Zone.

Minimum viable product:

-As a user, I need an accurate game board with sprites.
-As a user, I need deck randomizer set to Sorry! deck specs.
-As a user, I need piece movement linked to the deck randomizer.
-As a user, I need limitations to insure start conditions are met.
-As a user, I need acknowledgement of win conditions.
-As a user, I need playability for 2 players.


Reach Goals: 

-As a user, I want playability for 2-4 players.
-As a user, I want animated piece movements.
-As a user, I want scoreboard for multiple games.
-As a user, I want in-site game reset.
-As a user, I want player name storage.
-As a user, I want "relaxation start" functionality.
-As a user, I want responsive board size.

Foreseen challenges:

-While board logic is repetitive, the physical representation will be rotated.
-Areas of the board will require different sprite response.
-Movement around corners will be an animation difficulty.
-User chooses which of four sprites to apply movement to.
-Sprites on same square logic differs.

Technology I intend to use:

-Vanilla Javascript with jquery as needed for core game logic and DOM manipulation.
-HTML for the creation of the page and elements of the board / sprites / cards.
-CSS for styling all elements of the game and adding animation effects.
-Skeleton for instituting responsiveness.
