<h1>SORRY!</h1>
<h2>Welcome to four player Sorry!</h2>

<p>Each player in turn draws one card from the deck and follows its instructions. To begin the game, all of a player's four pawns are restricted to Start; a player can only move them out onto the rest of the board if he or she draws a 1 or 2 card. A 1 or a 2 places a pawn on the space directly outside of start (a 2 does not entitle the pawn to move a second space).</p>
<p>A pawn can jump over any other pawn during its move. However, two pawns cannot occupy the same square; a pawn that lands on a square occupied by another player's pawn "bumps" that pawn back to its own Start. Players can not bump their own pawns back to Start; if the only way to complete a move would result in a player bumping his or her own pawn, the player's pawns remain in place and the player loses his or her turn.</p>

<p>If a pawn lands at the start of a slide (except those of its own color), either by direct movement or as the result of a switch from a Sorry card, it immediately "slides" to the last square of the slide. All pawns on all spaces of the slide (including those belonging to the sliding player) are sent back to their respective Starts. Slides are designated by color on the board, and begin with an arrow.</p>
<p>
The last five squares before each player's Home are "Safety Zones", and are specially colored corresponding to the colors of the Homes they lead to. Access is limited to pawns of the same color. Pawns inside the Safety Zones are immune to being bumped by opponent's pawns or being switched with opponents' pawns via 11 or Sorry! cards. However, if a pawn is forced via a 4 card to move backwards out of the Safety Zone, it is no longer considered "safe" and may be bumped by or switched with opponents' pawns as usual until it re-enters the Safety Zone.</p>
<p>Once a pawn hits your purple square, it will be moved to the scoreboard.  The first to get all four pawns home wins!</p>
<p>Yellow will go first!</p>
